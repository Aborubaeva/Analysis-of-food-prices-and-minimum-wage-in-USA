The minimum wage serves as a crucial economic foundation in the United States, aiming to guarantee that individuals in low-wage positions can maintain a minimum standard of living. Nevertheless, an ongoing discussion surrounds whether the minimum wage adequately covers essential needs such as nutrition. This financial threshold significantly impacts the food choices and nutritional quality available to individuals and families who depend on these wages. A diet abundant in nutrients is essential not only for personal well-being but also for overall productivity and societal well-being.

In urban centers, particularly in areas with high living costs, the challenge of securing a nutritious diet on a minimum wage becomes even more difficult. The cost of living, including food prices, often increases faster than wage growth, forcing many people to rely on less expensive and often less nutritious food options. This dietary compromise can lead to increased health risks, highlighting a gap between wage policy and nutritional well-being.

Recent studies have focused on the implications of the Standard American Diet (SAD), which is characterized by high consumption of sugars, sodium, cholesterol, and ultra-processed foods. This diet has been associated with a higher risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and obesity (Mercola and D'Adamo, 2023). Additionally, the SAD typically includes a lower consumption of fruits and vegetables, which further exacerbates health risks (Carrera-Bastos et al., 2011).

Our research aims to explore the feasibility of maintaining a healthy diet on a minimum wage in the United States, with a particular focus on Bostonâ€”a city known for its significant student population and high living costs. We investigate whether individuals, especially vulnerable groups like students, can afford a nutritionally adequate diet under financial constraints. To accomplish this, we leverage data from Amazon Fresh for real-time food prices and use a weekly meal plan for 2255 calories/day created by artificial intelligence, ChatGPT, which follows the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and integrates nutrient data from the Kaggle Database of Micronutrients. Our findings aim to provide insights into how wage levels affect dietary options and public health in general.
